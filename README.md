Project Euler is a great way to practice problem solving skills
I'll be trying to solve those problems and each time I'll provide the solution here

1. Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5:
   If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

   Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
